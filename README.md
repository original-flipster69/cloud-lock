**cloud-lock** provides a means of distributed locking via cloud storage in Java. 
This letâ€™s you do leader election to run certain workloads only once when your service is scaled out horizontally. 
Doing it via cloud has the benefit of not needing to provision a database for that purpose if your service is stateless in the first place.

## Which cloud providers are supported?

At the moment, **cloud-lock** works with 3 different cloud storage solutions by the following providers:
- Google Cloud Storage (GCS) powered by **Google Cloud Platform**
- Azure Blob Storage powered by **Microsoft Azure**
